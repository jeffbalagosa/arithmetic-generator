# Project: Arithmetic Generator

## Description:

This is an app that gives you random arithmetic problems and keeps track of how many you got right in a row. If you get one wrong or you refresh the page, your score is reset.

We opted to give our kids activities to keep themselves busy instead of sending them to a summer camp or school. Even though we bought our daughter a bunch of workbooks to keep her mind sharp, I wanted to make something for her thatâ€™s a bit more gamified. This app is product of that.

I decided on a math app because she seemed to like the subject. Plus, my bias towards engineering was all for it.
