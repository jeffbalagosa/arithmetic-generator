# Project: Arithmetic Generator

## Description:

This is an app that gives you random arithmetic problems and keeps track of how many you got right in a row. If you get one wrong or you refresh the page, your score, or _streak_, is reset.

We opted to give our kids activities to keep themselves busy instead of sending them to a summer camp or school. Even though we bought our daughter a bunch of workbooks to keep her mind sharp, I wanted to make something for her thatâ€™s a bit more gamified. This app is product of that.

I decided on a math app because she seemed to like the subject. Plus, my bias towards engineering was all for it.

## Features:

## How to Use:

1. Solve the problem by putting your answer in the field provided.
2. Click submit to check if it's correct.
3. Streak goes up if it's correct.
4. Streak resets if it isn't. But you still get a chance to solve the problem.
5. After submitting your answer, you are presented with a button to generate a new problem.
